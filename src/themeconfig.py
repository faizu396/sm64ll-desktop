#Theme configuration

'''
In this file, you can customise the theme/colors of the launcher. There are four themes made by me.
To apply a diffierent theme, remove the three " ' " on the beggining and the end of a theme and add ones on the theme you had before.
To make your own theme copy one and paste it on the end of this file and edit it as you wish. You can use hex color codes or try to find pre-made colors 
that are in pysimplegui module (they were not documented on the module's docs site). Just remember that every color except "None" (the default color) needs
to be in two " ' ". If you do something wrong, the launcher will not start.
